      <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
      <p>
        <!-- PASTE MY SELF-ASSESSMENT HERE -->
        Throughout my time in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have developed 
        the foundational skills and professional mindset required to contribute meaningfully in the field of software 
        development. The coursework over the last two years has allowed me to reflect on my growth, refine my aforementioned 
        skills, and better understand how academic concepts are applicable in real-world scenarios. This Computer Science 
        capstone experience represents the culmination of that growth and demonstrates my readiness to ender into the computer 
        science profession.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the course of the program, I have gained experience in object-oriented programming, software design principles, algorithms
        and data structures, database management, and secure coding practices. Courses such as CS-360 (Mobile Architecture and Programming) 
        gave me the chance to not only understand how to write functional code, but how to design systems that are maintainable, efficient, 
        and secure. Developing this ePortfolio required me to revisit earlier work from this course with a more critical eye. I was easily 
        able to identify weaknesses and opportunities for improvement. This is an essential capability in professional software engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was an emphasis on collaboration/communication throughout the Computer Science program. This was made apparent via the use of 
        peer discussions, instructor feedback, code reviews, etc. The code review included in this portfolio reflects this skill, as it required 
        me to analyze existing code, identify flaws or potential areas for improvement, and communicate planned enhancements in a way that would 
        be clear and understandable. This portion of the capstone gave me the opportunity to use both verbal as well as written communication in 
        order to explain my thought process as it pertains to said enhancements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary artifact features in this portfolio is a mobile weight-tracking application originally developed in CS-360 (Mobile Architecture 
        and Programming). I selected this artifact because it provided a strong foundation for demonstrating growth across all three CS-499 areas of 
        focus (software engineering and design, algorithms and data structures, and databases).
      </p>
      <p>
        For the software engineering and design enhancement, I focused on improving usability, input validation, and application structure. I implemented 
        confirmation dialogs for deletions and customizable settings. I also disabled actions when inputs are invalid. All of these changes made for an 
        improved user experience. For the algorithms and data structures enhancement, I incorporated mathematical logic and data analysis to provide meaningful 
        insights to the user. Features such as weight-change calculations, trend analysis, and goal projection required structured data traversal and algorithmic 
        reasoning. These enhancements demonstrate my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles. For the database 
        enhancement, I focused on improving data organization and retrieval. For this category, I implemented sorting, entry counting, safe mass deletion 
        operations, as well as search functionality. These changes demonstrate my ability to use database concepts to deliver value while maintaining data 
        integrity and security.
